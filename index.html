      Use the arrow keys to pan the map. Hold Ctrl to instead move the yellow
      cursor around.

      To execute code, put hyphens on the top edge of your code block, pipes
      on the left edge, and finally an asterisk at the top-left corner.
      the World of Code uses a stack-based language. You can access memory
      by reading from cells.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Number literals from 0 - 255 by representing as hexadecimal
        (<i>note</i> – must be uppercase!)
      <li> <b>a b +</b>; <b>a b -</b>; <b>a b *</b>; <b>a b /</b> (integer
        division); <b>a b %</b> (spaces are completely optional)
      <li> <b>a b &gt;</b> and <b>a b =</b> to compare
      <li> <b>:</b> duplicates the topmost element; <b>.</b> deletes it
      <li> <b>X</b> exchanges the topmost 2 elements; <b>a Y</b> moves to the top
        the element buried by <b>a</b> others.
      <li> <b>a W</b> does the opposite.
      <li> <b>c x y ?</b> jumps to (x, y) if <b>c</b> is true.
      <li> <b>x y G</b> gets the character at (x, y). <b>x y n P</b> places a
        character (returning whether this succeeded). Note that only printable
        ASCII characters may be placed.
      <li> <b>x y ^</b> gets the absolute coordinates from an offset of the
        current location of execution. <b>x y $</b> uses the location wher
        code starts instead.
      <li> <b>!</b> gives the logical negation of the topmost element
        (0 turns into 1; any other value turns into 0)
      <li> Any lowercase letter can be used as a variable. To assign the
        topmost stack element to one, use <b>#</b> followed by the name.
      <li> <b>x y c K</b> calls a subroutine at (x, y). The <b>c</b> stack
        entries that were there beforehand are available to the subroutine.
      <li> <b>c R</b> returns from a subroutine to its caller. The <b>c</b>
        stack entries that were there beforehand are available to the caller.
    </ul>
